# Pointers
### This program is written in C and it performs swapping of two numbers using a function called "swap". It takes two integer variables "x" and "y" as input and passes their addresses to the swap function using the "&" operator. Inside the swap function, the values of x and y are swapped using a temporary variable "temp". Finally, the swapped values are printed in the main function.
